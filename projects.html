      <br/>
      <p>After four years at Meridian Technical Charter High School(MTCHS), I have learned a lot about not only the world of coding but myself as well.</p><br/>
      <p>This is where some project images and videos will go.</p></br/>
      <p>I have completed many projects. From php-SQL database connections to Java applications completed at school to batch file text-based games to python scripts done at home.
        These projects have increased my knowledge and interst in the world of coding and making things work the way I want them to.</p></br>
      <p>Because the host I am using won't let me run the php script or host the java applications here are some videos showing my projects.</p></br>

            <p>Project 5 in our Java Applications course was to make a music playlist. We had to create the frames, most of the classes, and make it work.
              The design consisted of the list of songs, ordered by default in the order they were inserted into the array, buttons just to the left of the
              list so one could reorder the songs however they wished. A grid of buttons to the right of the list that would play the song it was associated
              with, the grid would also refresh as you edited the list of songs. Below the list there is a play/stop button, a skip forward and skip backward,
              as well as text saying what song was playing and who the artist was.</p>

      <p>After four years at Meridian Technical Charter High School(MTCHS), I have learned a lot about not only the world of coding but myself as well.</p><br/>

      <p>I was born and raised in the city of Mesa, Arizona in the Mesa-Phoenix area. I moved twice, once from an apartment complex and once more to move to Boise.
        I have two brothers who, suprisingly, pushed me into my quest of the pursuit of knowledge. I played soccer in a league for 6 years, which then got me
        interested in a variety of sports. Football and playing baseball for example. Even with my interest in sports, it didn't stop me from gaining a little weight
        that I didn't lose until I moved here. Moving to a safer, more bike-friendly community gave me the freedom to bike and run all over the city. I was also able
        to learn the joys ultimate frisbee and rock climbing. I already loved to swim, but now I could do it more frequently at the local YMCA, and was able to bike
        to the library more often to read more books, which I also love to do.</p></br>
      <p>When I was 9 years old my aunt let me play a game called the Legend of the Dragoons. It's a wonderful game with a wonderful storyline, but really, let's say
        unsatisfying graphics. I became almost obsessed with trying to find a way to convince the makers of the game to re-make the game with better graphics and for
        a newer system, since it was for a PS1. Well, it never happend and I didn't think it ever could happen until my mom came across a technical school that taught
        graphic arts. So I applied and after many months of waiting, I was accepted.</p></br>
      <p>Initially when I entered Meridian Technical Charter High School, I had every intention of becoming a media artist. Through the second semester of Freshman year,
        I was set on becoming a media artist. Then I was introduced to the development side, with coding, scripting, and programming. I was fascinated by it, and couldn't
        decide which path I wanted to pursue! I went through Sophmore year undecisive and entered into the Design and Development Pathway for the Junior grade. At first,
        I tried to be a web developer who did both front-end media art and back end coding... Now I am a dedicated programmer/coder/scripter, anything having to do with
        computer languages.</p></br>
      <p>Some people have trouble reading code or script. That was one skill I always seemed to have, along with others. I have also gained many skills, and am proud that
        dedication and being a quick learner are just a couple of them. Working hard and asking questions are just two of the abilities I have gained to become a better
        coder, as well as several others that allow me to futher my education in this wonderful and fascinating world of coding.</p>

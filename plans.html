      <p>After graduating form MTCHS I plan on taking advantage of the free time in the summer to work, visit with family, and prepare myself for bootcamp for the Navy.
        I'll be shipping out in August then after approximately 8 weeks I'll be in Florida for schooling in my field. I have a garunteed contract that I will be working,
        as a Cryptologic Technician (Networks) a.k.a. CTN.</p><br/>
      <p>Being a CTN wasn't even my first choice actually. My first choice was to be a CT Interpretive, basically a linguist that specializes in a language and
        interprets from the foreign language to english. Whether it be code, speech, text, or anything else. I wasn't able to get CTI because there is a special test that
        you have to take in order to be a CTI. It's called the D-Lab and it essentially tests your ability to learn a new language. Since the career that I have wasn't my
        first choice I have plans to continue on through the 6 year contract in full as a CTN then after preparing for the D-Lab throughout the contract, retake the test
        and try to get a second contract as a CTI.</p><br/>
      <p>I'm not completely sure what I'll do after my second contract. I might try to specialize in the CT field and become a warrant officer or try to become a chief.
        After my time of service in the Navy I'll see if I can't get some sort of government job. I'm not sure what I'll want to do or where I'll even be but it wouldn't
        be a bad idea. Just because of the double benefits, although the increased expericence is another valid and main point.</p>

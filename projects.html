      <br/>
      <p>After four years at Meridian Technical Charter High School(MTCHS), I have learned a lot about not only the world of coding but myself as well.</p><br/>
      <p>This is where some project images and videos will go.</p></br/>
      <p>I have completed many projects. From php-SQL database connections to Java applications completed at school to batch file text-based games to python scripts done at home.
        These projects have increased my knowledge and interst in the world of coding and making things work the way I want them to.</p></br>
      <p>Because the host I am using won't let me run the php script or host the java applications here are some videos showing my projects.</p></br>
